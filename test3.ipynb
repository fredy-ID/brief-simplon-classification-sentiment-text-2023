You‚Äôll need to re-enter your My O2 username and password, you‚Äôll then be sent a verification code via text to your phone. Once this has been confirmed you can enter your new SIM info and this will be swapped within 24hrs.\\n\\xa0\\nAs mentioned above you can also text ‚ÄòSwap‚Äô to 20220 to activate it.\\n\\xa0\\nIf you don‚Äôt have an active SIM to do either of the above to you‚Äôll need to call customer services to activate it.
